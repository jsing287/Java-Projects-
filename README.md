[TennisBall]

The TennisBall folder holds a series of Java, JavaFX, and fxml files that together form a GUI capable of delivering a data base management system for handling an organization. The user can create new matches and teams, update scores, view Team standings and more. The program utilizes multiple Java files that act as controllers for handling GUI events of new fxml files within the program. The program uses a NoSQL database to store program data and SQL to access this data and manipulate the database.
